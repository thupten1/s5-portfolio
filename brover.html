                            Hi welcome, this is my portfolio for semester 5. I did my internship at Zeliox where I had to make a app for Brover. This app is voor the intake en checking a company vehicle , at this moment the user exprience is not good and there are lot of bugs and errors. It's my job to design and create a new app.

                                In the first week of my internship, we wrote the project plan as we came up with the planning and approach, we also came to an agreement regarding communication. Within the planning there are few phases and sprints. If you would like to see the planning, I would recommend reading the <a href="./assets/pdf/Project_plan.pdf" target="blank">“Project plan”</a>.

                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                In the next 4 week of my internship we focused on orienting, in this phase we research and gathered more information regarding our project. As a result, we had a better understand of the assignment. After this we began with the first phase researching. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                First we wanted to know about the current system, therefore we held an flied research. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                We wanted to gather answer on “What are the wishes and need of our target group, so that we know which parts of the process should be simplified?” First, we needed to know more about our target audience. Therefore, we did flied research and held an <a href="">interview</a> with the people uses the app. This gave us a better view about our target audience.
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                Next, we did flied research, and did a <a href="">Participant observation</a> with the users. We did this as we wanted to know their wishes and needs, after all we found out there were a lot of bugs and improvement points on the current system which made the app feel like a BETA version.
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                We made a <a href="">persona</a> as we wanted to create our ideal target audience. We did this because we can combine important things from multiple users and implement this to one user.
                                In addition, we made <a href="">empathy map</a> to combine our research insights and to get a clear overview about what our target audience wants, says, like, dislikes and more.                            
                            </p>

                                We even did field research, to be exact a <a href="">Survey</a> to know what the abilities are of us
                                target group, regarding technology. So that we can take it into account with the UI. We didn’t have any good insights, because I didn’t setup a good question and didn’t knew how to analyze the answer.                             
                            </p>

                                After the research phase, we moved on to the define phase. In this phase we analysed our findings from the research phase and defined our problem which was “There is a lot of small problems, all these small problems combined created a bad user experience”. We came up with solutions to make a new native app in Flutter. We chose for a native app because it has better hardware support then a PWA, the reason we wanted to program with Flutter is because then the app is compatible with IOS and Android. Furthermore, we wanted to create an app with excellent user experience, to achieve this we did literature research on design principles (<a href="">Design document</a>). We compared different design principles and chose the one that fits the best for our project. Next, we defined what tools and methods we are going to use, to succeed this project.                         
                            </p>

                                After define phase we started with the design phase, we worked on this for 2 weeks. Therefore, we started to gather some inspirations, we looked at buttons, steppers and cool designs that would fit out project.

                                Frist, we started to create a wireframe, we chose for a simple wireframe because we wanted to create a minimum viable product. This was done very fast; with this we got a view of how the app could look like. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                After this, we create a design which was more detailed version 1. This version had few changes in the home page and the menu bar. Also, we create a visual hierarchy that matches the user’s needs with the use of our color, contrast and highlighted the important things.
                            </p>

                                Meanwhile, we have taken the design principles into account when making the design. For example, we have ensured that there is little distraction for the user, so that he/she can complete their tasks without being disturbed.

                                After talking to our target audience and the product owner we got some few feedback on the design, to meet their wishes, we created a new design. This version 2 is high quality prototype, we implemented the morphism button design, and choses for a rounded stepper. This gave a more professional look.

                                Version 2.1 was created after we did some user test, where we found our users didn’t knew the scrollable part. Furthermore, orange was not the same as the Brover’s orange. We managed to change the color.

                                In the <a href="">Design document</a> we documented this phase in more detail with images. We also have a substantiation of how we have used the design principles.

                                After the design phase, we started the develop phase, we chose to use the current Git environment which was already used for the current app. We chose to do this because the current app has few components which we can reuse.

                                We started to learn flutter, since we didn’t have a lot of knowledge. We started to learn the basics and the layout structure. Soon we found out about widgets and classes and that it was built like a tree of widgets. We then made the front-end of the home page.
                            </p>

                                Next, we needed to make a stepper, our internship supervisor told us to make a custom stepper. This was because the material stepper was not nice to work with and after all making a custom stepper would help a lot with gaining knowledge about programming. We had to learn about state management. I spent a very long time in this part of programming as I found it quite difficult.

                                After the stepper was successful build. We wanted the VIN to be visible on each step. We couldn’t do this because each step made a new state. To solve this, we did some research on the web and found out about MVVM (model view, view model). With this we managed to send information from view to view-model and managed to show the VIN on each step. 
                            </p>

                                    Looking back at this internship period, we learned a lot. Specially programming with flutter. In the first place, it was very difficult to work with flutter. After a lot of research and programming we were finally able to build the design in flutter.

The reason we chose for interview is because asking questions in person is a lot easier. Plus, we can instanly get answers. That's why we started drafting questions, in order to be well prepared.

                                Lorem Ipsum is slechts een proeftekst uit het drukkerij- en zetterijwezen. Lorem Ipsum is de standaard proeftekst in deze bedrijfstak sinds de 16e eeuw, toen een onbekende drukker een zethaak met letters nam en ze door elkaar husselde om een font-catalogus te maken. Het heeft niet alleen vijf eeuwen overleefd maar is ook, vrijwel onveranderd, overgenomen in elektronische letterzetting. Het is in de jaren '60 populair geworden met de introductie van Letraset vellen met Lorem Ipsum passages en meer recentelijk door desktop publishing software zoals Aldus PageMaker die versies van Lorem Ipsum bevatten.

                                As a solution Brover wants a new app. Before we start with developing, we need to think about how we are going to make this a successful project. Are we going to build PWA (progressive web app) or a Native app? How are we going to improve the user exprience? Which tools are we going to use? How are we going to test? These are the question we want to answer in this pahse.

                                We discussed this with the supervisor, there are pros and cons for both options. PWA is very easy because no installation is required, has features of web and app and it has a strong foundation for further development. On the other side, the use of a hardware is limited. the client later wants to use the app to digitize the work process, they want to use NFC chips. In this case the native app is much better since it has more hardware support. This is the reason we chose to build a Native app.

                                    For planning we want to work with Scrum, Zeliox already works with scrum. Therefore, we use Atlassian. This tool is perfect for planning, to keep an overview of our project and task division. Furthermore, we are using the double diamond method, we did this because want to develop an app while keeping the human centered.

                                    Zeliox already has an own GitLab repo where we can make use of. This is the same tool Fontys uses for version control. There was no reason for me to use another version control. As a tool to use our repo we used a build in tool in Visual studio code to push, pull commit etc. Sometimes we used GitHub desktop because it has a better interface.

                                    We thought about how we want to develop the app. Our company wanted to make this app in flutter since colleagues who had experience with flutter. This is nice for maintaining the app after my internship period. Furthermore, Flutter app can run on IOS as well as on Android this save up a lot of time.

                                    For documentation we used Word and overleaf. In first place our internship coordinator wants us to document our research in overleaf.  The reason behind this was that research papers are also written with LaTeX, and you can use for example overleaf as a tool. The pro’s about using overleaf is that you can make changes very quick, add links and it’s very easy to reference to an asset.

                                    For communication we use Slack. This is a common tool that is used within the company. Furthermore, we use WhatsApp as well. The important messages are communicated through Slack.
