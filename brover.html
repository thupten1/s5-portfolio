                            Hi welcome, this is my portfolio for semester 5. I did my internship at Zeliox where I had to make a app for Brover. This app is voor the intake en checking a company vehicle , at this moment the user exprience is not good and there are lot of bugs and errors. It's my job to design and create a new app.

                                This assignment contains a number of functionalities such as taking pictures, being able to post a comment, to identify a car.

Therefore, we did flied research and held an <a href="./assets/pdf/Interview_current_system.pdf" target="blank">interview</a> with the people uses the app. This gave us a better view about our target audience.

                                Next, we did flied research, and did a Participant observation / <a href="./assets/pdf/Interview_wishes_and_needs.pdf" target="blank">interview</a> with the users. We did this as we wanted to know their wishes and needs, after all we found out there were a lot of bugs and improvement points on the current system which made the app feel like a BETA version.

                                We made a <a href="">persona</a> as we wanted to create our ideal target audience. We did this because we can combine important things from multiple users and implement this to one user.
                                In addition, we made <a href="">empathy map</a> to combine our research insights and to get a clear overview about what our target audience wants, says, like, dislikes and more.

                                We even did field research, to be exact a <a href="">Survey</a> to know what the abilities are of us
                                target group, regarding technology. So that we can take it into account with the UI. We didn’t have any good insights, because I didn’t setup a good question and didn’t knew how to analyze the answer.

                                After the research phase, we moved on to the <a href="./assets/pdf/Define.pdf" target="blank">define phase</a>. In this phase we analysed our findings from the research phase and defined our problem which was “There is a lot of small problems, all these small problems combined created a bad user experience”. We came up with solutions to make a new native app in Flutter. We chose for a native app because it has better hardware support then a PWA, the reason we wanted to program with Flutter is because then the app is compatible with IOS and Android. Furthermore, we wanted to create an app with excellent user experience, to achieve this we did literature research on design principles (<a href="./assets/pdf/design_document.pdf" target="blank">Design document</a>). We compared different design principles and chose the one that fits the best for our project. Next, we defined what tools and methods we are going to use, to succeed this project.                         
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="subheader">Design</h2>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                After define phase we started with the design phase, we worked on this for 2 weeks. Therefore, we started to gather some inspirations, we looked at buttons, steppers and cool designs that would fit out project. We decided to ask the user which button and stepper they think its user friendly. Therefore, we did field research and used a survey <a href="./assets/pdf/design_document.pdf" target="blank">(design document)</a> to get answers. As a result, we 50% from the 10 users choose for stepper 1 and for the button 70% choose for the Neomorphism button. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                Next, we started to create a wireframe, we chose for a simple wireframe because we wanted to create a minimum viable product. This was done very fast; with this we got a view of how the app could look like. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                After this, we create a design which was more detailed version 1. This version had few changes in the home page and the menu bar. Also, we create a visual hierarchy that matches the user’s needs with the use of our color, contrast and highlighted the important things.
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                Meanwhile, we have taken the design principles into account when making the design. For example, we have ensured that there is little distraction for the user, so that he/she can complete their tasks without being disturbed.
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                After talking to our target audience and the product owner we got some few feedback on the design, to meet their wishes, we created a new design. This version 2 is high quality prototype, we implemented the morphism button design, and choses for a rounded stepper. This gave a more professional look.
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                Version 2.1 was created, where we found our users didn’t knew the scrollable part. Furthermore, orange was not the same as the Brover’s orange. We managed to change the color.  
                           </p>
                           <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                We did a <a href="./assets/pdf/usertest.pdf" target="blank">user test</a> to find out if this design was user friendly, we did this trough <a href="https://maze.co/" target="blank">Maze.</a> The result was very positive, almost everybody can navigate through the app. There were few prototype errors. Next time we must make a better prototype with no errors. 
                           </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                In the <a href="./assets/pdf/design_document.pdf" target="blank">Design document</a> we documented this phase in more detail with images. We also have a substantiation of how we have used the design principles, we used the design principle to improve the user friendliness.

                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                After the design phase, we started the develop phase, we chose to use the current Git environment which was already used for the current app. We chose to do this because the current app has few components which we can reuse. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                We started to learn flutter, since we didn’t have a lot of knowledge. We started to learn the basics and the layout structure. Soon we found out about widgets and classes and that it was built like a tree of widgets. We then made the front-end of the home page.
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                Next, we needed to make a stepper, our internship supervisor told us to make a custom stepper. This was because the material stepper was not nice to work with and after all making a custom stepper would help a lot with gaining knowledge about programming. We had to learn about state management. I spent a very long time in this part of programming as I found it quite difficult.
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                This stepper is the core navigator throughout the app, each step is loaded by changing steps. After the stepper was successful build. We started with developing step 1 entering VIN (Vehicle identification number), this went easy, we reused the scanner widget from the old version. Next, we made step 2, here we wanted the VIN to be visible on each step. We couldn’t do this because each step made a new route. To solve this, we did some research on the web and found out about MVVM (model view, view model). With this we managed to send information from view to view-model and able to show the VIN on each step.
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                Foreach steps made different components, as result we could reuse a component. Step 4 was a bit difficult and was a struggle as we wanted to take pictures and show the images in a list view. Therefore, we had to work with list of XFiles. 
                            </p>

                                We did not manage to finish the app, there are still few important things to do to improve the user experience. In step 3 the control step, the buttons need to be default on “no” and there need to be a scroll bar so users know they can scroll on this part. Furthermore, we wanted to filter the VIN and automatic fill the car brand and type, this prevents mistakes by the user and speeds up the process. 
                            </p>

                                The vehicle check part still needs to be developed but this won’t take long as we can reuse the code on intake. The check part is built in 2 steps scan or type the VIN part and image part, where user can take picture of the vehicle.

                                    Looking back at this internship period, we learned a lot. Specially programming with flutter. In the first place, it was very difficult to work with flutter. After a lot of research and programming we were finally able to build the design in flutter.

                                    My goal was to learn about design principles and to make a design like a professional.

                                    After the interview we found out that an automated intake and check app already existed. Brover wanted a new app because the old app was not very nice, the user exprience was very poor this was mainly because the app had couple of errors.

                                for this we have created a persona so that we do not forget that, the use of this method is important because this is human centered design.

We then compared the result with the results of interview current system, to get a more insights.

                                    </br>Frist, the app needs to be in dutch. There are people in the factory who can not speak english. Second, the camera needs to have a good resolution because the last time the camera's scale was really bad and it was very hard to take good picture. Third, all double names should be deleted. Furthermore, our users would like too see a comment section after taking picture and there is no feedback after an action is been done.

                                Lorem Ipsum is slechts een proeftekst uit het drukkerij- en zetterijwezen. Lorem Ipsum is de standaard proeftekst in deze bedrijfstak sinds de 16e eeuw, toen een onbekende drukker een zethaak met letters nam en ze door elkaar husselde om een font-catalogus te maken. Het heeft niet alleen vijf eeuwen overleefd maar is ook, vrijwel onveranderd, overgenomen in elektronische letterzetting. Het is in de jaren '60 populair geworden met de introductie van Letraset vellen met Lorem Ipsum passages en meer recentelijk door desktop publishing software zoals Aldus PageMaker die versies van Lorem Ipsum bevatten.

                                As a solution Brover wants a new app. Before we start with developing, we need to think about how we are going to make this a successful project. Are we going to build PWA (progressive web app) or a Native app? How are we going to improve the user exprience? Which tools are we going to use? How are we going to test? These are the question we want to answer in this pahse.

                                We discussed this with the supervisor, there are pros and cons for both options. PWA is very easy because no installation is required, has features of web and app and it has a strong foundation for further development. On the other side, the use of a hardware is limited. the client later wants to use the app to digitize the work process, they want to use NFC chips. In this case the native app is much better since it has more hardware support. This is the reason we chose to build a Native app.

                                    Zeliox already has an own GitLab repo where we can make use of. This is the same tool Fontys uses for version control. There was no reason for me to use another version control. As a tool to use our repo we used a build in tool in Visual studio code to push, pull commit etc. Sometimes we used GitHub desktop because it has a better interface.

This is nice for maintaining the app after my internship period. Furthermore, Flutter app can run on IOS as well as on Android this save up a lot of time.

                                    For documentation we used Word and overleaf. In first place our internship coordinator wants us to document our research in overleaf.  The reason behind this was that research papers are also written with LaTeX, and you can use for example overleaf as a tool. The pro’s about using overleaf is that you can make changes very quick, add links and it’s very easy to reference to an asset.

We used design principles to improve the user experience, before using the design principle we compared various design principle which we found on <a target="_blank" href="https://principles.design/">https://principles.design/</a> and chose the best fitting to our needs.

                                After gathering our research insights, we started to look for inspirations. Frist, we thought about what elements do we need in our app? For example, we are going to use a stepper in our app, so I searched some steppers on the internet to get inspired. We did this also for the other elements like buttons eventually we found Neumorphism buttons, this looked very modern so we thought maybe we can use this in our app.

                                We did field research where we asked people which design element they would rather use. We did this through a survey. We asked 10 users few steppers and buttons and gave them the options to choose

                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                As a result, from the 10 people 50% choose for option 1. 30% choose for option 6 and 20% choose for option 4. Which means that option 1 is the most patent stepper. Furthermore, for the button it was obvious, 70% choose option 1 which was the neomorphism button. 
                                Based on this result we are going to use neomorphism button and stepper option 1

                                We made a quick wireframe, we kept it very simple as we wanted to make a minimal viable product. The reason for this is to get a feel of how the app is going to look. You see a Home page with menu on the bottom, also when you click on “Intake” it will bring you to a new page. This page has a stepper on the top, with few options.
                            </p>
                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                As in the design principles, we gave them a few choices like would you like type or scan the VIN? Furthermore, we kept the group related object near each other, we created for each step a page, because otherwise it would be too busy.                             
                            </p>

                                After the wireframe we created the better design, more detailed. We changed the design of our home page and made changes in the menu, we placed this on the bottom still but made it a button and not a menu bar. Also, we create a visual hierarchy that matches the user’s needs with the use of our color, contrast and kept the important things good to reach.

                                After talking to our target audience and the product owner we got some few feedback on the design, to meet their wishes, we created a new design. This is high quality prototype, we implemented the morphism button design, and choses for a rounded stepper.

                                There were few things we wanted to change. We kept away the camera button page, because this step was unnecessary. Furthermore, the colour was not exact same as Brover’s orange, and we added a scrollbar so that users know which part is scrollable. We also used the design principle while designing, open the design document to read how we implemented the design principle in this design.

                                Our goal with the user test was to check if the app was user friendly. Users need to be able to work with the app even with zero knowledge about intake and check app. By giving people few scenarios. They must go through the tasks give their feedback.

                                We are very happy with the result, the design is clear and users can easily navigate through it. Of course there were some things that weren't right, but those are mostly prototype errors. Next time we will first correct the prototype so that no navigation error can occur.

Furthermore, flutter app works on apple as well as on android.

                                At first, we had no knowledge regarding programming with flutter. So, we started to learn the basics and started to learn about global theme. We decided to learn this because we wanted to create the front-end, with global theme it’s very easy to change a color by just adjusting a variable.

For us this was a breakthrough, because now we knew how to build up a page. We managed to build the home page with build in Top Bar with a menu. We also created the neomorphism button. This was not a normal button we had to create a container with styling and event listener.

                                Our next step was to build a stepper, we did some research on flutter and found a build in stepper, our internship supervisor told us to make a custom stepper. The reason for this was that the build-in stepper does not support functions we need and making an own stepper will help us to be a better programmer.

                            <p class="animated delay-first fade-right maintext">
                                To develop a custom stepper, we needed to learn about state management. I spent a very long time in this part of programming as I found it quite difficult. You have stateless widget and stateful widget stateless widget you can't change the state and with stateful widget you 
                                can. I also had to apply this to my project which I found very difficult. it was only after a week or 2 with the help of my internship supervisor that I managed to do this.

                                After we made the stepper, we started with the first step which was entering VIN. We used the QR-code/barcode scanner component from the old version of the app which worked fine. This step has also a page where you can type in VIN.

                                Soon we found out each step create its own routes, as result we could not pass the VIN to the next step. We wanted the VIN to be visible on each step. To solve this, we did some research on the web and found out about MVVM (Model view/view model). MVVM is useful to move business logic from view to ViewModel and Model. ViewModel is the mediator between View and Model which carry all user events and return the result.

                                In this step we used the model view to get the VIN. Also, we needed to create a neomorphism button to do this we created a component. Furthermore, we added a text field so users can type in comments. On the bottom we added 2 buttons, one to go to previous step and one to go to the next step.

                                We wanted the button to be default on “Nee”, unfortunately I didn’t had time to program this. This still had to be done, this will improve the user experience. Now de buttons are not clickable. We still have to program a on press function for this button.
